  In the absence of an adequacy decision, the {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the {data subject|index:data-subject}. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of {binding corporate rules|index:binding-corporate-rules}, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} or contractual clauses authorised by a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to {processing|index:processing} within the Union, including the availability of enforceable {data subject|index:data-subject} rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to {personal data|index:personal-data} {processing|index:processing}, the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are not legally binding.
