  Directive 95/46/EC provided for a general obligation to notify the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} to the supervisory authorities. While that
  obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases
  contribute to improving the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}. Such
  indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and
  replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types
  of {processing|index:processing} operations which are likely to result in a high
  risk to the rights and freedoms of {natural persons|index:natural-person} by virtue
  of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of {processing|index:processing}
  operations may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or
  are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried
  out before by the {controller|index:controller}, or where they become necessary
  in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial {processing|index:processing}.
