  When {personal data|index:personal-data} moves across borders outside the Union
  it may put at increased risk the ability of {natural persons|index:natural-person}
  to exercise data protection rights in particular to protect themselves from the
  unlawful use or disclosure of that information. At the same time, supervisory authorities
  may find that they are unable to pursue complaints or conduct investigations relating
  to the activities outside their borders. Their efforts to work together in the cross-border
  context may also be hampered by insufficient preventative or remedial powers, inconsistent
  legal regimes, and practical obstacles like resource constraints. Therefore, there
  is a need to promote closer cooperation among data protection supervisory authorities
  to help them exchange information and carry out investigations with their international
  counterparts. For the purposes of developing international cooperation mechanisms
  to facilitate and provide international mutual assistance for the enforcement of
  legislation for the protection of {personal data|index:personal-data}, the Commission
  and the supervisory authorities should exchange information and cooperate in activities
  related to the exercise of their powers with competent authorities in third countries,
  based on reciprocity and in accordance with this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
