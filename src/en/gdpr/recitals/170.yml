  Since the objective of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, namely to ensure an equivalent level of protection of {natural persons|index:natural-person} and the free flow of {personal data|index:personal-data} throughout the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this {Regulation|index:regulation} does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
