  Where a court seized of proceedings against a decision by a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
  has reason to believe that proceedings concerning the same {processing|index:processing},
  such as the same subject matter as regards {processing|index:processing} by the
  same {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor}, or the same cause
  of action, are brought before a competent court in another Member State, it should
  contact that court in order to confirm the existence of such related proceedings.
  If related proceedings are pending before a court in another Member State, any court
  other than the court first seized may stay its proceedings or may, on request of
  one of the parties, decline jurisdiction in favour of the court first seized if
  that court has jurisdiction over the proceedings in question and its law permits
  the consolidation of such related proceedings. Proceedings are deemed to be related
  where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them
  together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate
  proceedings.
