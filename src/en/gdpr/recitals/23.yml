  In order to ensure that {natural persons|index:natural-person} are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this {Regulation|index:regulation}, the {processing|index:processing} of {personal data|index:personal-data} of data subjects who are in the Union by a {controller|index:controller} or a {processor|index:processor} not established in the Union should be subject to this {Regulation|index:regulation} where the {processing|index:processing} activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the {controller|index:controller} or {processor|index:processor} envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the {controller|index:controller} is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the {controller|index:controller} envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union.
