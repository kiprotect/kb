  Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers required and necessary
  for important reasons of public interest, for example in cases of international
  data exchange between competition authorities, tax or customs administrations, between
  financial supervisory authorities, between services competent for social security
  matters, or for public health, for example in the case of contact tracing for contagious
  diseases or in order to reduce and/or eliminate doping in sport. A transfer of {personal
  data|index:personal-data} should also be regarded as lawful where it is necessary
  to protect an interest which is essential for the data subject's or another person's
  vital interests, including physical integrity or life, if the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  is incapable of giving {consent|index:consent}. In the absence of an adequacy decision,
  Union or Member State law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly
  set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third country or
  an {international organisation|index:international-organisation}. Member States
  should notify such provisions to the Commission. Any transfer to an international
  humanitarian organisation of {personal data|index:personal-data} of a {data subject|index:data-subject}
  who is physically or legally incapable of giving {consent|index:consent}, with a
  view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva Conventions or to complying
  with international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered
  to be necessary for an important reason of public interest or because it is in the
  vital interest of the {data subject|index:data-subject}.
