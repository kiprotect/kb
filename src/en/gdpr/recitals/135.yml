  In order to ensure the consistent application of this {Regulation|index:regulation}
  throughout the Union, a consistency mechanism for cooperation between the supervisory
  authorities should be established. That mechanism should in particular apply where
  a {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority} intends to adopt a measure
  intended to produce legal effects as regards {processing|index:processing} operations
  which substantially affect a significant number of data subjects in several Member
  States. It should also apply where any {supervisory authority|index:supervisory-authority}
  concerned or the Commission requests that such matter should be handled in the consistency
  mechanism. That mechanism should be without prejudice to any measures that the Commission
  may take in the exercise of its powers under the Treaties.
