  The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public
  or to the {data subject|index:data-subject} be concise, easily accessible and easy
  to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate,
  visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for
  example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular
  relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological
  complexity of practice make it difficult for the {data subject|index:data-subject}
  to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose {personal data|index:personal-data}
  relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising.
  Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication,
  where {processing|index:processing} is addressed to a child, should be in such a
  clear and plain language that the child can easily understand.
