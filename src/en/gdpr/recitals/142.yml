  Where a {data subject|index:data-subject} considers that his or her rights under
  this {Regulation|index:regulation} are infringed, he or she should have the right
  to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which is constituted
  in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are
  in the public interest and is active in the field of the protection of {personal
  data|index:personal-data} to lodge a complaint on his or her behalf with a {supervisory
  authority|index:supervisory-authority}, exercise the right to a judicial remedy
  on behalf of data subjects or, if provided for in Member State law, exercise the
  right to receive compensation on behalf of data subjects. A Member State may provide
  for such a body, organisation or association to have the right to lodge a complaint
  in that Member State, independently of a data subject's mandate, and the right to
  an effective judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of
  a {data subject|index:data-subject} have been infringed as a result of the {processing|index:processing}
  of {personal data|index:personal-data} which infringes this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
  That body, organisation or association may not be allowed to claim compensation
  on a data subject's behalf independently of the data subject's mandate.
