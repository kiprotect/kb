  In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular
  the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of the
  third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country, take
  into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access to
  justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its general
  and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security, defence and
  national security as well as public order and criminal law. The adoption of an adequacy
  decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should
  take into account clear and objective criteria, such as specific {processing|index:processing}
  activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force
  in the third country. The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate
  level of protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in
  particular where {personal data|index:personal-data} are processed in one or several
  specific sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent
  data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the
  Member States' data protection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided
  with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial
  redress.
