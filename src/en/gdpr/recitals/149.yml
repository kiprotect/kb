  Member States should be able to lay down the rules on criminal penalties for infringements
  of this {Regulation|index:regulation}, including for infringements of national rules
  adopted pursuant to and within the limits of this {Regulation|index:regulation}.
  Those criminal penalties may also allow for the deprivation of the profits obtained
  through infringements of this {Regulation|index:regulation}. However, the imposition
  of criminal penalties for infringements of such national rules and of administrative
  penalties should not lead to a breach of the principle of ne bis in idem, as interpreted
  by the Court of Justice.
